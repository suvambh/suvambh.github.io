  Hi, my name's Suvam. 
  I recently finished a Ph.D. in Quantum Physics and now I am coding all day for no reason!
  This resulted in me getting skilled at : <mark>python</mark> <mark>statistical learning</mark> and  <mark>algorithms</mark>

          Experimental and numerical modelling of the mysterious <mark>quantum spin liquid</mark> state of matter.

          Investigation of the Quantum Spin Liquid state. 
          The rise of quantum materials observed in the past decades has been a source of great excitement for scientists and engineers, with the flourishing of new concepts and electronic phases of matter. 
          These new quantum phases are of fundamental importance given the promise they hold for future technological advancements. 
          My personal motivation was to gain a better understanding of the nature of the physical reality by exploring these 'weird' states of matter. 
          As we are figuring out now, these phases of matter goes against all common intuitions and hold the possibility to display a range of exciting exotic physics.
          My research included experimentation with quantum spin liquid candidate materials coupled with theoretical development, modelling and simulations.
